        text: 'When muscles become injured or overused, they can develop knots and scar tissue. These adhesions can cause pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. Deep Tissue Massage works by using slow, deliberate strokes and deep pressure to target these areas of tension. The massage therapist will use their fingers, knuckles, and elbows to apply pressure, helping to break up adhesions and restore normal muscle function.'
